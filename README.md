# Hi, Iâ€™m @StriderDunedain!
Hello there! My name's Max and I'm a Python backend developer (still in learning though but already know quite much). No idea how to write a good readme, so prepare yourselves :)
Here's what I can currently do (I regularly update it, so check it out often):
 - Django and DRF
 - Docker
 - MySQL and a little of PostgreSQL for databases
 - Basic Linux OS knowledge
 - Basic DevOps techniques and whatnot
 - Python in general

### More about me as a human being
I am almost 17 and enjoy wide range of things in many subjects!
 1. Passion for languages - I know **Russian** (as a native speaker), **English** (good enough to read Shakespear) and **German** (on my way to B1)
 2. **Love reading books** on almost any subject (except for love novels, not my cup of tea)
 3. Interested in all sciences but mainly these - **Biology, Chem and Physics**
 4. Aspire to get into the **University of Vienna**
 5. Also a big fan of **fantasy and sci-fi** - Lovecraft, Poe, Tolkien, Asimov are among my favourite writers!

### Afterword, I guess?
If you'd like to collaborate on something, I'd love to! Just DM me
